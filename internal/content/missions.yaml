  - id: "0.1-where-am-i"
    skill_id: pwd
    level: 0
    title: Where Am I?
    briefing: |
      You've just opened a terminal. You're somewhere in the filesystem,
      but where? Find out your current location.
    hint: There's a command that prints the working directory...
    explanation: |
      pwd = Print Working Directory. It shows the full path to where you are.
      You're in /home/learner/projects.
    commands: [pwd]
    setup:
      - cd: /home/learner/projects
    goal:
      always: true

  - id: "0.2-whats-here"
    skill_id: ls
    level: 0
    title: What's Here?
    briefing: |
      You know where you are. Now look around.
      What files and folders are in this directory?
    hint: Two letters. Short for 'list'.
    explanation: |
      ls = list. It shows you everything in the current directory.
      You can see readme.txt, src/, and docs/.
    commands: [ls]
    setup:
      - mkdir: /home/learner/projects
      - touch: /home/learner/projects/readme.txt

    skill_id: cd
    level: 0
    title: Go Home
    briefing: |
      You're in /tmp. That's not where you belong.
      Navigate to your home directory.
    hint: cd without any arguments takes you home. Or try cd ~
    explanation: |
      cd = change directory. By itself, cd takes you home.
      ~ is shorthand for your home directory.
    commands: [cd, "cd ~"]
    setup:
      - mkdir: /tmp
      - cd: /tmp

    level: 0
    title: Enter the Projects Folder
    briefing: |
      You're home. There's a 'projects' folder here. Go inside it.

    explanation: |
      cd foldername moves you into that folder.
      You can always use pwd to check where you ended up.
    commands: ["cd projects"]
    setup:
      - mkdir: /home/learner/projects
      - cd: /home/learner

    briefing: |
      From /home/learner, get to /home/learner/documents/work in one command.
    hint: You can type a path - cd folder/subfolder
    explanation: |
      You can navigate multiple levels at once: cd folder/subfolder.
      This is faster than cd folder then cd subfolder.
    commands: ["cd documents/work"]
    setup:
      - mkdir: /home/learner/documents/work
      - cd: /home/learner
    goal:

      The .env file contains secrets!
    commands: ["ls -a"]
    setup:
      - mkdir: /home/learner/project

      src/, tests/, and docs/ folders, plus a README.md file.
    hint: Use mkdir for folders, touch for files. You can chain commands.
    explanation: |
      Good project structure is a habit. src/ for code, tests/ for tests,

      Find all .py files under /home/learner/project,
      then create a backup of main.py as main.py.bak
    hint: find for searching, cp for backup
    explanation: |
      Real workflow: find files, understand structure, make backups before editing.
      Professionals always backup first!

      and also check what WARNING messages exist.

    explanation: |
      Targeted cleanup: find what to delete, verify, then remove.

      Figure out: Where are you? What's here? Are there any hidden files?
      Do this in three commands.
    hint: pwd, ls, ls -a
